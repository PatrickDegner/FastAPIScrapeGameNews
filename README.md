## How it works:
BeautifulSoup gets us the infos needed.

Then we go after the attributes to find specific informations of date title and news.

The news are read into a Pandas DataFrame and saved to csv.

Next time you refresh your page, the Scraper gets news again and appends them if there are new news.


Simple scrape + serve to an API done! :)
